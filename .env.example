RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Until you verify a domain at resend.com/domains, Resend only allows sending to the account owner's email.
# Set this to your Resend account email (e.g. abhipatel3240@gmail.com) so the form works. After domain verification, remove it to use the default recipient (hymaday.app@gmail.com).
# CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=abhipatel3240@gmail.com

# After verifying a domain: set "from" to an email on that domain so you can send to any recipient.
# CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL=GYMADAY <noreply@yourdomain.com>

# Optional: "Do Business With Us" footer button. Default: /partner (our form → gymaday.app@gmail.com via Resend).
# To open a Google Form instead, set this to your form URL (e.g. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/xxx/viewform).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTNER_FORM_URL=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/xxx/viewform
